# dripThis site stands for term project of internet programming project in Univercity of Seoul.**drip** has goal which simple image recognition with data base system with php.This prject inspired Optical Character Recognition(OCR), which could be found at[Wikipedia:Optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) or real time on screen translation.
# Prerequisite--Recognition--*[TensorFlow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)*[Keras installation guide](https ://keras.io/#guiding-principles)
 # TODO List - [] Recognition - [] UI - [] Backend system
 # KeyWords * Deep learning * Image recognition * Lexical analyzer - Lex * Syntax analyzer - Parser * BNF * Identifier / Variable * Number * Operator * Operand * Infix to Postfix * Function Generator * First class function * High order function * Evaluation * Function chaining Additional feature -- - *Learning process * Operator addition / definition
 # Concept ![alt test](/ Concept / Pictures / Concept.png) When a image uploaded by user(in User Interface), image process module digitalize the image and compare that with saved **Diffusioned Data** in data base then, make decision which is the most appropriate one(**Tag**).After make decision, the user interface system interact with user that which the tag is right.
 # Implemetation Implemetation could be vary and almost one take 2 layer matrix system before output, but with some limitation, we take **Diffusion Data** when the pixel of a image has some value.
 # Class Diagram ![alt text](/ Concept / Pictures / abstract.jpg) Our project divided by three part, Image Processing, User Interface and Data Base.Above diagram represent this modules usally one direction relation ship except User Interface module and storage object in image processing.
